## Content
Bring your infectious enthusiasm to an audience with a short attention span! Discuss a program, software, hardware, system or technique! Pitch your projects and ideas or try to rally a crew of people to join you! Whatever you bring, make it quick! 

## Timeslots

Please have a look at the session schedule of the lightning talk slots. The lightning talks have a slot of 5 minutes including setup.
